# Graph_Theory_Project
by Darragh Lally - G00220290

Welcome to my README which I would like to use to introduce my Graph Theory Project as set by my lecturer Dr. Ian McLoughlin, using Python to create a program that will make an NFA (implementing Thompsons Construction) from a parsed regular expression, and check if a string passed in is excepted in that NFA's language. 

## To Use
* Run regex.py with: *python regex.py*
* User will be asked to input a regular expression
* User will be asked for string to be tested
* Program will output Accepted or Not Accepted
* User will be asked if they wish to continue
	* y to go again
	* n to terminate

## Extra Features
* Console input
* Accepted Operators
	* One or More \+
	* Zero or One \?


## Useful resources
I found plenty of useful information both online and through Ians video series on the project. I have broken the resources up into catogories in which they were used.

### PEP Docs
https://www.python.org/
Note: I added my own 'style' between classes and functions. The documentation suggests 2 and 3 line spaces but I find it easier to read when there is a clear break between blocks. I do hope this is acceptable!

### Python Tutorials
Note: Used for example to find out the correct function for console input, with my version of python I must use raw_input\(\).
