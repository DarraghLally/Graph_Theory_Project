# Graph_Theory_Project
by Darragh Lally - G00220290

Welcome to my README which I would like to use to introduce my Graph Theory Project as set by my lecturer Dr. Ian McLoughlin, using Python to create a program that will make an NFA (implementing Thompsons Construction) from a parsed regular expression, and check if a string passed in is excepted in that NFA's language. Please see <a href="https://github.com/DarraghLally/Graph_Theory_Project/blob/master/overview.md">overview.md</a> for a more comprehensive breakdown. 

## To Use
* Run regex.py with: *python regex.py*
* User will be asked to input a regular expression
* User will be asked for string to be tested
* Program will output Accepted or Not Accepted
* User will be asked if they wish to continue
	* y to go again
	* n to terminate

## Extra Features
* Console input
* Accepted Operators
	* One or More \+
	* Zero or One \?


## Conclusion
Although Ian provided most of the code for this project and guided us through putting it together, I feel like I have learned multiple lessons along the way.
* Exposure to Python -
While we touched on the language last year, this modual has showen me how simple and powerful the Python language can be. Using it exclusively to create this regex machine was very enjoyable.
* Exposure to VIM -
This was a major learning curve for me as I had not been exposed to it in the past. And I love it! Yes it is hard to get used to but once I learned some key features: Copy, Paste and cut, undo and some more, well lets just say I wish I started using it earlier in my education. I have also started watching videos on more advanced VIM use. It has encouraged me to start using my Linux partition.
* Science -
Solving a problems with software is really fun, this module has shone a light on a different side of Computer Science to the one we meet in many of our other modules. In regards to that, and the knowledge that there is a Course Review ongoing, I encourage you to keep this module or even expand it as I think it will be of great benefit to those choosing to study at GMIT.        
* Large amount of commits due to not been able to see my updated work through VIM, I did not use an IDE throughout the project, just VIM. I uploaded pictures directly to GitHub to include in overview.md. 
* Cannot stress how valuable the Python Documentation has been.
