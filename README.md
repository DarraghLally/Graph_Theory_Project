# Graph_Theory_Project
by Darragh Lally - G00220290

Welcome to my README which I would like to use to introduce my Graph Theory Project as set by my lecturer Dr. Ian McLoughlin, using Python to create a program that will make an NFA (implementing Thompsons Construction), and check if a string passed in is excepted in that NFA's language. This repository contains my solution and research elements. I go into more depth in this repositories WIKI pages.
