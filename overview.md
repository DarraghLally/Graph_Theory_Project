## Introduction
Welcome to my overview.md, here I will pitch the idea of this project to the reader. I am aiming for it to be a guide for incomming 3rd year student. This project was developed for our Graph Theory module. We are to create a python program that takes two inputs,
* Regular Expression - eg a.b
* String to be tested - ab
By passing both the above via console the program will execute, giving back a True or False depending if the string is excepted in the language of the regular expression.

## Run
There are a number of steps involved to run this program.
1. Download and install Python
2. Clone/Download my repository
3. Execute program

Each of these steps have a number of sub steps involved. Start with installing Python.
* Using your broswer navigate to 'https://www.python.org/downloads/'
* Select 'Download Python (current version number)' this will begin downloading the installer
* Save file to your machine.
* Open file and follow the instructions.
* To check that it has in fact downloaded
	* Click on Windows button
	* Type CMD
	* When the command window opens type 'python --version'
	* You should see a message with Python and its version number

I found plenty of useful information both online and through Ians video series on the project. I have broken the resources up into catogories in which they were used.

### PEP Docs

Note: I added my own 'style' between classes and functions. The documentation suggests 2 and 3 line spaces but I find it easier to read when there is a clear break between blocks. I do hope this is acceptable!

### Python Tutorials
Note: Used for example to find out the correct function for console input, with my version of python I must use raw_input\(\).
